Question 1

Most of the ratings fall between 2 and 4 with some potential outliers below 2 and one above 5.
```{r}
boxplot(choco$Rating)
```

Question 2

No, the ratings do not depend on the cocoa percentage of the chocolate bar as the scatter plot has no definitive shape.

``` {r}
plot(choco$Cocoa.Pct, choco$Rating)
```

Question 3

The class is "factor". Factors have a set amount of "levels" that help you sort the variables whereas characters do not.

```{r}
class(choco$Company.Location)
```
